# Movie-DataSet-Advanced-Visualization-and-Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM
Built a scalable model to perform analysis. We start by preparing the data, cleaning and preprocessing. Then, we proceed to Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. After visualization, we use Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the output and increase the efficiency. Lastly, we use LSTM Network to analyze sentiment based on user feedback and provide sentimental analysis on movies.
